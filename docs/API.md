# An API for interacting with the SST graph

The simplest way to manage graphs is to use the N4L language to create
and manage them, then rebuild the whole database consistently as a
cache of the information. This makes editing very intuitive and simple.
However, sometimes you want to work directly with a programming interface.

The most flexible way to deal with graphs is to program using the
API. There are two API approaches you can use (in principle):

- Adding nodes and links without caring about assigning node pointers. This uses the `SST.Vertex(ctx,str,chap)` and `SST.Edge(ctx,nfrom,"fwd",nto,context,w)` functions.
- Adding nodes and links in bulk and managing node pointers yourself. This uses the `SST.IdempDBAddNode(ctx, np)`, `SST.IdempDBAddLink(ctx,np,lnk,nt)`, and `SST.CreateDBNodeArrowNode(ctx,np,lnk,sttype)`.

Most will use only the first of these.  Both interfaces behave
idempotently and work in the same way. The only difference is whether
you allocate `NodePtr` values yourself (which is efficient for large
numbers of entrites).

Because the database behaves like a cache, optimized for quite different use-cases,
we have to maintain several tables.

<pre>
sstoryline=# \dt
              List of relations
 Schema |      Name      | Type  |   Owner    
--------+----------------+-------+------------
 public | arrowdirectory | table | sstoryline
 public | arrowinverses  | table | sstoryline
 public | node           | table | sstoryline
 public | nodearrownode  | table | sstoryline
 public | pagemap        | table | sstoryline

</pre>

Another thing we need to do is register arrow definitions used in links/edges.
For this we use two functions: `SST.InsertArrowDirectory(stname,alias,name,pm string)` and
`SST.InsertInverseArrowDirectory(fwd,bwd ArrowPtr)`. We need to register arrows before using them
in links.

## Examples

The API examples is the `src` directory are stripped down to the minimum, and the special
tools llike the pathsolver and notes tool show how to make simple wrappers for the API functions too.
You will also find many examples of using Go(lang) code to write custom scripts
that interact with the database through the Go API
[here](https://github.com/markburgess/SSTorytime/tree/main/src/demo_pocs).


## Creating an SST graph from data

See the [example](../src/API_EXAMPLE_1.go). To make node registration as easy as possible, you can use two functions
`Vertex()` and `Edge()` to create nodes and links respectively. These names are chosen to distance themselves
from the underlying `Node` and `Link`naming, by using the more mathematical names for these objects.

### Open/Close the connection to SST

Assuming the arrow names have been defined (e.g. by uploading them using N4L),
then to open the context channel for the database, we bracket the meat of a program with
Open and Close functions:

<pre>
func main() {

	load_arrows := false
	ctx := SST.Open(load_arrows)

	AddStory(ctx)
	LookupStory(ctx)

	SST.Close(ctx)
}

</pre>

### Add nodes and links from data

For the meat of an AddStory function, we can use the Vertex and Edge functions to avoid low level details.
Adding nodes to a database, without using the N4L language is straightforward:
<pre>
	chap := "home and away"
	context := []string{""}
	var w float32 = 1.0

	n1 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"Mary had a little lamb",chap)
	n2 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"Whose fleece was dull and grey",chap)

	n3 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"And every time she washed it clean",chap)
	n4 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"It just went to roll in the hay",chap)

	n5 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"And when it reached a certain age ",chap)
	n6 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"She'd serve it on a tray",chap)

	SST.Edge(ctx,n1,"then",n2,context,w)

	// bifurcation!

	SST.Edge(ctx,n2,"then",n3,context,w/2)
	SST.Edge(ctx,n2,"then",n5,context,w/2)

	// endings

	SST.Edge(ctx,n3,"then",n4,context,w)
	SST.Edge(ctx,n5,"then",n6,context,w)

</pre>

### Adding hub-joins (hyperlinks) from data

See `API_EXAMPLE_2.go`. In a `HubJoin()` we provide a list of node pointers
to be linked together via  a common hub. This respects the Semantic Spacetime
rules and simulates a hyperlink.
<pre>
	// Then create a container mummy_node for all and arrow type is "is contained by"

	created := SST.HubJoin(ctx,"mummy_node","my chapter",nptrs,"is contained by",nil,nil)
	fmt.Println("Creates hub node",created2)

        // Create 
</pre>
If you don't set the chapter, and all the nodes belong to the same chapter,
then the method will adopt the same chapter as the children  belong to.
Similarly, if you don't want to give the hub node a name, then leave it empty:
<pre>
	created := SST.HubJoin(ctx,"","",nptrs,"then",context,weights)
	fmt.Println("Creates hub node",created1)

</pre>
the name of the node will be uniquely formed from a list of the node pointers,
starting "hub_<arrow>_<nodelist>".

### Reading the graph back


Looking up up the data is more complicated because there are many options.
This example looks for story paths starting from a node that we search for by name.
<ol>
<li>First we get a pointer to the starting node by random access lookup:
<pre>
	start_set := SST.GetDBNodePtrMatchingName(ctx,"Mary had a","")
</pre>
Because there might be several nodes that match your name description, this returns
an array of pointers.

<li>Next we want to know the Semantic Spacetime type of link to follow.
If you remember the numbers -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 of the link type (leadsto,contains,property,near)
you can select `sttype` directly. If you only remember the name of the relation, you can search
for it:
<pre>
	_,sttype := SST.GetDBArrowsWithArrowName(ctx,"then")
</pre>
<li>Setting a limit on the path length to explore, you search for the forward cone
of type `sttype` from the starting set of node pointers.
<pre>
	path_length := 4

	for n := range start_set {

		paths,_ := SST.GetFwdPathsAsLinks(ctx,start_set[n],sttype,path_length)

		for p := range paths {

			if len(paths[p]) > 1 {
			
				fmt.Println("    Path",p," len",len(paths[p]))

				for l := 0; l < len(paths[p]); l++ {

					// Find the long node name details from the pointer

					name := SST.GetDBNodeByNodePtr(ctx,paths[p][l].Dst).S

					fmt.Println("    ",l,"xx  --> ",
						paths[p][l].Dst,"=",name,"  , weight",
						paths[p][l].Wgt,"context",paths[p][l].Ctx)
				}
			}
		}
	}

</pre>
</ol>

### Checking the result

Running the `API_EXAMPLE.go` program:
<pre>
$ cd src
$ make
go build -o API_EXAMPLE API_EXAMPLE.go
$ ./API_EXAMPLE 
    Path 0  len 4
     0 xx  -->  {4 0} = Mary had a little lamb   , weight 1 context []
     1 xx  -->  {4 2} = Whose fleece was white as snow   , weight 1 context [cutting edge high brow poem]
     2 xx  -->  {4 3} = And everywhere that Mary went   , weight 1 context [cutting edge high brow poem]
     3 xx  -->  {4 4} = The lamb was sure to go   , weight 1 context [cutting edge high brow poem]
    Path 1  len 4
     0 xx  -->  {4 0} = Mary had a little lamb   , weight 1 context []
     1 xx  -->  {4 987} = Whose fleece was dull and grey   , weight 1 context []
     2 xx  -->  {4 988} = And every time she washed it clean   , weight 0.5 context []
     3 xx  -->  {4 989} = It just went to roll in the hay   , weight 1 context []
    Path 2  len 4
     0 xx  -->  {4 0} = Mary had a little lamb   , weight 1 context []
     1 xx  -->  {4 987} = Whose fleece was dull and grey   , weight 1 context []
     2 xx  -->  {4 990} = And when it reached a certain age    , weight 0.5 context []
     3 xx  -->  {4 991} = She'd serve it on a tray   , weight 1 context []

</pre>

## Searching a graph

We need to respect the geometry of the semantic spacetime when tracing and presenting paths.
Out major focus will tend to be by STtype.

* Find a starting place (random lookup).
* Decide on the capture region and criterion for search.
* * Select the cone of a particular STtype, for a picture of its relationships.
* * Find all possible paths, without restriction on semantics.

The search patterns can be:
<pre>
            by Name                                    GetNodeNotes/Orbits
START match by Chapter     ---> (set of NodePtr)  -->  GetFwdPaths (by STtype)
            by first Arrow                             GetFwdBwdPaths (by signless STtype)
            by Context                                 GetEntireCone (for all types)
</pre>

## Low level wrapper functions 

In general, you will want to use the special functions written for
querying the data.  These return data into Go structures directly,
performing all the marshalling and de-marshalling. The following are
basic workhorses. You will not normally use these.
For example, [see demo](https://github.com/markburgess/SSTorytime/blob/main/src/demo_pocs/postgres_stories.go).

## Web JSON queries

Query data returned by searches are addressed to the `http_server.go` program handler as POST requests, either with a
command string into a `name` field, or as an NPtr reference sent as two separate form variables `nclass` and `ncptr`
for the two components of and `NPtr`.

The returned data are best understood as one of two paradigms: either i) story paths, which are arrays of `Link` structures (the
first of which is a singleton (a destination Node without an arrow), or ii) orbitals, which model a single node at a time with a cloud
of arrow paths up to two arrows in length, and corresponding to satellites of the original node (see the figure below to see the
geometry).

![Alpha interface](https://github.com/markburgess/SSTorytime/blob/main/docs/figs/geometry.png 'Testing a web interface')

Data are returned in JSON packages by the `PackageResponse()` function, which
wraps data in a structure:
<pre>
{
 "Response" : SWITCHCASE,
 "Content"  : data,
 "Time"     : <internal>,
 "Intent"   : <internal>, 
 "Ambient"  : <internal> 
}
</pre>
where the `data` are returned in one of a number of formats (below).
The `SWITCHCASE` is handled in the web javascript parser as follows:
<pre>
  switch (SWITCHCASE) 
     {
     case "Orbits":
          DoOrbitPanel(resp);
          break;
     case "ConePaths":
          DoEntireConePanel(resp);
          break;
     case "PathSolve":
          DoEntireConePanel(resp);
          break;
     case "Sequence":
          DoSeqPanel(resp);
          break;
     case "PageMap":
          DoPageMapPanel(resp);
          break;
     case "TOC":
          DoTOCPanel(resp);
          break;
     case "Arrows":
          DoArrowsPanel(resp);
          break;
     case "STAT":
          DoStatsPanel(resp);
          break;
     }
</pre>
So each of these functions basically renders a fixed type JSON structure, in a manner appropriate to its purpose.


### NodeEvents and their Orbits

The simplest kind of lookup is a single topic match, returning a
Node. When we get a Node, we return the `S` string, the `NPtr`
reference and the `Chapter` and `Context` sets associated with each
match. Each orbiting is a collection of `NodeEvent`s in JSON:

### NodeEvent

A `NodeEvent` is a structur containing the data for a single Node information.
It refers to `Orbits` which are precompiled paths reaching out from the Node
to a depth of two hops. Coordinates `XYZ` are pre-calculated by the server based on the
semantics of the search.

<pre>
type NodeEvent struct {

	Text    string
	L       int
	Chap    string
	Context string
        NPtr    NodePtr
	XYZ     Coords
	Orbits  [ST_TOP][]Orbit
}
</pre>

The orbital references are listed as a set of arrays much like the
STtype collection of `Link` arrays in the server and database's
internal Node representation. There are 7 lists indicating the arrow
name, it's spacetime time and the destination Node Ptr and its text
along with relative coordinates. `OOO` is the origin coordinate of the
body a satellite orbits, (i.e. radius one orbits the original search
node, radius 2 orbits one of the radius one satellites).  There is
sufficient information in this to collate all the satellites of a
particular STtype into a single list.  <pre> type Orbit struct {

	Radius  int
	Arrow   string
	STindex int
	Dst     NodePtr
	Ctx     string
	Text    string
	XYZ     Coords  // coords
	OOO     Coords  // origin
}
</pre>

### WebPath

Go internal `Link` arrays are transformed into `WebPath` objects that have all pointers expanded.
<pre>
type WebPath struct {
	NPtr    NodePtr
	Arr     ArrowPtr
	STindex int
	Line    int
	Name    string
	Chp     string
	Ctx     string
	XYZ     Coords
}
</pre>

### Story

Story searches are a simple wrapping of a `NodeEvent` array, with encapsulating Chapter.
<pre>
type Story struct {

	Chapter   string
	Axis      []NodeEvent
}
</pre>


### WebConePaths

`WebConePaths` are wrappers around arrays of `WebPath` arrays
(analogous to the `[][]Link` arrays in the figure above), which are
held in the `Paths` field. Additional information is provided by the
server: The title of the cone, as some explanation of its semantics,
an array of 'betweenness centrality' scores for the paths, and an
array of supernode sets that are calculated by the server based on
path
[symmetries](https://mark-burgess-oslo-mb.medium.com/semantic-spacetime-1-the-shape-of-knowledge-86daced424a5).

<pre>
type WebConePaths struct {

	RootNode   NodePtr
	Title      string
	BTWC       []string
	Paths      [][]WebPath
	SuperNodes []string
}
</pre>


## Basic queries from SQL

Using perfectly standard SQL, you can interrogate the database established by N4L or the low level API
functions.

### Tables

* To show the different tables:
<pre>
$ psql storyline

storyline=# \dt
               List of relations

Indexes:

* An alternative view of relations is provided by NodeArrowNode:
<pre>
storyline=# select *  from NodeArrowNode LIMIT 10;

 (1,1) |      1 |  68 |   1 | {news,online}                 | (2,291)
 (1,2) |      1 |  66 |   1 | {thankyou,please,"thank you"} | (1,1)
 (1,3) |     -1 |  69 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,4)
 (1,4) |     -1 |  67 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,5)

 (1,5) |      1 |  66 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,4)
 (1,6) |     -1 |  67 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (4,0)
(10 rows)

</pre>

Notice how nodes (`nfrom`,`nto`,`nptr? ) and arrows (`arr`) are represented by pointer references
that are integers. When working with the graph, we often don't need to know the names
of things, we can get away with deferring the lookup of the actual data until we find what we're
looking for. That information can be cached so as to minimize the data transferred over the wire.

<pre>
storyline=# select S from Node where NPtr=(1,5);
   s    
--------
 xièxiè
(1 row)

</pre>

### Links and Arrows

A link is a composite relation that involves an arrow (pointer), a context,
and a destination node. Links are anchored to their origin nodes in the `Node` table
in the six columns `im3`, `im2`, `im1`, `in0`, `il1`, `ic2`, `ie3`.  
To find the links of type `Leads to':
<pre>
storyline=# select Il1 from Node where NPtr=(1,5);
                                       il1                                        
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"(66,1,\"{ \"\"please\"\", \"\"thank you\"\", \"\"thankyou\"\" }\",\"(1,4)\")"}
(1 row)

</pre>

Arrows are defined for each arrow pointer in the arrow directory:

<pre>
storyline=# select * from arrowdirectory limit 10;
 staindex |         long         | short | arrptr 
----------+----------------------+-------+--------
        4 | leads to             | lt    |      0
        2 | arriving from        | af    |      1
        4 | forwards             | fwd   |      2

## The Go(lang) interfaces

The SSToryline package tries to make querying the data structures easy, by providing
generic scriptable functions that can be used easily in Go.

The open a database connection, to make any kind of query, with the help of the SSToryline package:
<pre>

package main

import (
	"fmt"
        SST "SSTorytime"
)

//******************************************************************

const (
	host     = "localhost"
	port     = 5432
	user     = "sstoryline"
	password = "sst_1234"
	dbname   = "storyline"
)

//******************************************************************

func main() {

	load_arrows := false

	ctx := SST.Open(load_arrows)

	row,err := ctx.DB.Query("SELECT NFrom,Arr,NTo FROM NodeArrowNode LIMIT 10")

	var a,c string	
	var b int

	for row.Next() {		
		err = row.Scan(&a,&b,&c)
		fmt.Println(a,b,c)
	}
	
	row.Close()

	SST.Close(ctx)
}
