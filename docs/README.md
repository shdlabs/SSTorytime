## The tools

The tool-set consistent of several components, starting with:

* [N4L](N4L.md) - The N4L compiler (This is now merged with N4L-db)

* [searchN4L](searchN4L.md) - a simple and experimental command line tool for testing the graph database

* [text2N4L](text2N4L.md) - scan a text file and turn it into a set of notes in N4L file for further editing

* [removeN4L](removeN4L.md) - remove an uploaded chapter from the database

* [notes](notes.md) - a simple command line browser of notes in page view layout

* [pathsolve](pathsolve.md) - a simple and experimental command line tool for testing the graph database

* [graph_report](graph_report.md) - a simple and experimental command line tool for reporting on graph data, detecting loops, sources, sinks, etc, symmetrizing on different links and finding eigenvector centrality.

* [http_server](http_server.md) - a prototype webserver providing the SSTorytime browsing service

* [API_EXAMPLE_1](API_EXAMPLE_1.go) - a simple store and retrieve example of the graph database.

* [API_EXAMPLE_2](API_EXAMPLE_2.go) - multi/hyperlink example, joining several nodes through a central hub.

* [API_EXAMPLE_3](API_EXAMPLE_3.go) - a maze solving example, showing higher functions.

* [API_EXAMPLE_4](API_EXAMPLE_4.go) - a path solving example, with
  loop corrections (quantum style).

* [python_integration_example.py](../cmd/python_integration_example.py) - a basic Python example

* [SSTorytime.py](../cmd/SSTorytime.py) - Includable Python interface for SSTorytime, basic functions (TBD)
