# `http_server` and web

The http server provided is a generic browsing interface. It isn't meant to be the last
word on browsing the graph. In principle, every application might have its own custom
interface. This web page illustrates the Web API and is used to develop our thinking around
graphs.

The web server takes a resources root and optional listen/TLS paths:
<pre>
./http_server -resources /data/directory
./http_server -http :8080 -https :8443 -cert ../server/cert.pem -key ../server/key.pem
</pre>
This is a directory path which serves as a root for any file paths referenced in URLs, e.g.
where images of documents may be cached in order to be accessible from links rendered in the
browser. It may include any kind of MIME type, such as music files, images, documents etc.

For example, if we share a folder called `/mnt/Recordings`, then start the server
<pre>
./http_server -resources /mnt/Recordings
</pre>
which leads to a disk file
<pre>
/mnt/Recordings/Rush/Presto/Folder.jpg
</pre>
which maps an image reference
<pre>
/Resources/Rush/Presto/Folder.jpg
</pre>
to the URL
<pre>
http://localhost:8080/Resources/Rush/Presto/Folder.jpg
</pre>

* HTTP on port **8080** (redirects to HTTPS); HTTPS on **8443**. Override with `-http` / `-https`.

## Four search formats

The web server renders four different kinds of page.

* Ad hoc topic view, showing the orbits of random search sets (e.g. `brain&!whale)
* Page notes (N4L view, e.g. `\notes chinese`)
* Story/Sequence view (`\seq astronomy` or `\story (huli)`)
* Path solutions (`\from` a set of nodes `\to` a set of nodes).
