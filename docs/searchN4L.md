# searchN4L

This is a tool for querying the database. This is redesigned to avoid having to use command line options.
The only command line option is `-v` for verbose output, which is helpful for debugging.

## Commands

The tool recognizes a number of words. This is a mixed blessing. The interpreter might
accidentally misunderstand your search words for commands. You can always quote search terms
to protect them.

- `on` `for` `about`
- `note` or `page`

- `path` or `seq`
- -  `from`
- -  `to`

- `context` or `ctx`
- `as`

- `chapter` or `section` or `in`

- `arrow`

- `limit` or `depth` or `range` or `distance`


SSToryline allows you to use node addresses, called NPtr-s, which are coordinates looking like `(a,b)`. These are shown in searches
in case you want to go quickly to a specific dode.

Text searches are otherwise based on substring matches, unless you mark a string with pling/bang/exclamation characters,
e.g. `search !a1!` which matches the full precise string 'a1'. This can be a problem for short strings, e.g. suppose
you have notes

<pre>
- alphabet

  A (comes from) Greek letter Alpha
  B
  C

</pre>
The chances that 'A' is a substring of another string is very high! So if you want to access that, without knowing
its actual coordinate NPtr, you can write `!A!` to find it uniquely.

## Examples

<pre>
topic
from mytopic
notes about chinese context restaurant
notes chapter brain
please in chinese
paths from a1 to s1
</pre>

Using the pre-loaded examples, you can try:

## Search for nodes and their close neighbour orbits matching a name
<pre>
$ ./searchN4L Mark
------------------------------------------------------------------

0: supermarket
      -    (english has hanzi) - 超市
      -    (hanzi has pinyin) - chāoshì  .. food, shopping


1: I'm looking for snacks in the supermarket
      -    (english has hanzi) - 我在找超市的零食去
      -    (hanzi has pinyin) - wǒ zài zhǎo chāoshì de língshí qù  .. food, shopping

      -    (is a note or remark about) - stored procedures/functions in postgres

</pre>

## Searching when you can't type unicode accents

If you can only get English characters on your keyboard, you can still search for accented
words by placing parentheses around them "(...)":
<pre>
% ./searchN4L  "(fangzi)" chapter "chinese" 
------------------------------------------------------------------

0: fángzi
      -    (pinyin has hanzi) - 房子
           -    (hanzi has english) - house  .. at home, domestic


1: fángzǐ de fùjìn yǒu hěnduō piàoliang de huā
      -    (pinyin has hanzi) - 房子的附近有很多漂亮的花
           -    (hanzi has english) - there are many beautiful flowers near the house  .. area, environment
      neighbourhood, region


2: wǒ de chē zài fángzǐ pángbiān
      -    (pinyin has hanzi) - 我的车在房子旁边
           -    (hanzi has english) - my car is next to the house  .. configuration, directions,
     from, layout, position, toward
</pre>

## Searching for anything in a given context

<pre>
$ ./searchN4L %% context smalltalk brain wave limit 3
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limiting to maximum of 3 results
------------------------------------------------------------------

0: what's up?   in chapter: notes on chinese

      -    (english has hanzi) - 什么事
           -    (hanzi has pinyin) - shénme shì         .. in the context of knowing, questions, smalltalk, talking, understanding

2: type 2       in chapter: neuroscience brain

      -    (is part of) - theta waves
           -    (is discussed in) - Left–right-alternating theta sweeps in entorhinal–hippocampal maps of space         ..
     in the context of references
           -    (has frequency) - 4-8 Hz        .. in the context of oscillations, waves


</pre>

## Searching by direct NodePtr references

If you know about the database internals, you can look up node pointers directly
as long as you quote the parentheses for the shell.
Notice how the indentation shows you the distance from the starting node.
<pre>
./searchN4L "(1,1)"
------------------------------------------------------------------

0: door
      -    (leads to) - passage
           -    (leads to) - target 1  .. connectivity, path example, physics
      -    (leads to) - road
           -    (english has hanzi) - 路  .. browsing, caution, walking
           -    (leads to) - target 2  .. connectivity, path example, physics
      -    (leads to) - river
           -    (english has hanzi) - 河  .. nature
           -    (english has hanzi) - 江  .. nature
           -    (leads to) - target 3  .. connectivity, path example, physics
      -    (comes from / arriving from) - start
           -    (english has hanzi) - 开始  .. common verbs, doing, look, see, using, wanting

</pre>

## Searching for related contexts

Context strings are clustered into groups. If you don't remember, you can search:
<pre>
% ./searchN4L context restaurant
  0. "buildings"
  1. "come"
  2. "come in"
  3. "cooking"
  4. "eating"
  5. "enter"
  6. "restaurant"
  7. "rooms"
  8. "transport"
  9. "vehicles"
</pre>


## Searching for arrows

You can look up arrow definitions too, by name, number, or spacetime type.
The output format is `arrowptr, sttype, long name`:
<pre>
$ ./searchN4L arrow ph,pe
192. (3) ph -> pinyin has hanzi
190. (3) pe -> pinyin has english

$ ./searchN4L arrow 125
125. (-2) during -> happened during

$ ./searchN4L arrow -2
  9. (-2) in -> is in
 11. (-2) is an emphatic proto-concept in -> is emph in
 13. (-2) is mentioned in -> ismentin
 89. (-2) part -> is component of
 91. (-2) inset -> is part of set
 93. (-2) subby -> is subsumed by
 95. (-2) isencl -> is enclosed by
 97. (-2) swby -> is swallowed by
 99. (-2) pt -> is part of
101. (-2) wordin -> is a word used in

</pre>

## Searching for paths

You can search for paths from one location to another:
<pre>
 ./searchN4L from start to "target 1"
------------------------------------------------------------------

     - story path:  start  -(leads to)->  door  -(leads to)->  passage  -(debug)->  target 1
     -  [ Link STTypes: -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)-> . ]
</pre>
The default path length limtis to 5 hops. There might be longer paths, so you can add a depth
to force a larger search:

<pre>
$ ./searchN4L paths from a7 to i6 depth 16
</pre>
or simply
<pre>
$ ./searchN4L a7 to i6 depth 16
------------------------------------------------------------------

     - story path:  maze_a7  -(forwards)->  maze_b7  -(forwards)->  maze_b6  -(forwards)->  maze_c6
      -(forwards)->  maze_c5  -(forwards)->  maze_b5  -(forwards)->  maze_b4
      -(forwards)->  maze_a4  -(forwards)->  maze_a3  -(forwards)->  maze_b3
      -(forwards)->  maze_c3  -(forwards)->  maze_d3  -(forwards)->  maze_d2
      -(forwards)->  maze_e2  -(forwards)->  maze_e3  -(debug)->  maze_f3
      -(debug)->  maze_f4  -(debug)->  maze_e4  -(debug)->  maze_e5
      -(debug)->  maze_f5  -(debug)->  maze_f6  -(debug)->  maze_g6
      -(debug)->  maze_g5  -(debug)->  maze_g4  -(debug)->  maze_h4
      -(debug)->  maze_h5  -(debug)->  maze_h6  -(debug)->  maze_i6
     -  [ Link STTypes: -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)->  -(+leads to)-> . ]
