  :: setup, get started ::

  SSTorytime  (depends on) postgres
       "      (depends on) "postgres_contrib package for unaccent() function"
       "      (depends on) go programming language
       "      (note) made with Linux but doesn't depend on anything specific to Linux
       "      (has feature) supports all human languages in Unicode (note) languages that don't use spaces between words may have some issues


   :: motivation, _sequence_ ::

  The goal is to implement useful search patterns for a graph structure in an efficient way.

  Because database connection is slow, we do as much as possible to reduce that amount of data sent over the wire by performing all processing internally. (note) This has the tradeoff of using a slow script language in the database kernel.

  Loading data into a database, with validation, is slow. Retrieving is much faster.

  A graph is basically a structure with an index at every node. There are two modes of use: random access lookup for starting a search--which SQL is already good at, and exploring, path tracing, following leads from that starting point like hypertext.

  Most graph databases don't give any guidance in modelling or searching. They are based on SQL random access search, but this is not how we need to use graphs. 

  Graphs are for following paths with different meanings - or "semantics".

        "      (note) AI and LLMs produce fluid language, which is not in note form.
